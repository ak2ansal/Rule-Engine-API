# Rule-Engine-API
The Rule Engine Project enables real-time creation, evaluation, and management of business rules through a simple UI. Users can define rules, combine them with logical operators, and store them in a database for future use. Powered by Flask, Socket.IO, and SQLite, the project ensures seamless rule-based automation.
